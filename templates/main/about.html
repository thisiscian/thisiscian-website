		<p>i am a currently a performance engineer, working in oracle</p>
		<p>i have a strong interest in coding, and a small interest in web design</p>
		<p>i play a heck of a lot of computer games, and i really like weird co-op indie games</p>

		<h2 class="skin-header">website</h2>
		<p>
			This website has been generated using a lovely combination of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">django</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://purecss.io">pure</a>
		</p>
		<p>
		django serves the webpages, and is the reason i can have lovely urls, which i don't currently use
		</p>
		<p>
			pure, on the other hand, delivers the aesthetic for the site, and is especially useful for making the site responsive (eh, mobile users?)
		</p>
		<p>
			i think most of all, this site is a work in progress, so it might look terrible, and it might not work
		</p>
